                            <p>Here’s some benefits of using a CMS that aren’t available with other website options </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                <span class="font-weight-bold">No programming experience required</span> : Content management systems, like WordPress, were built for users with little to no programming experience. Once your website is fully developed by a web design professional, 
                                managing the actual content on your website is simple and easy to learn.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Easy Collaboration and Access</span> : Content management systems allow multiple people to not only have access to your website, but also easily collaborate on different projects. Using individual accounts, multiple people can add, edit, or update content on the site right from their own computers or devices. 
                                    CMS’ also store all of your online content for you in one place and is available to anyone with access to the website, meaning the need to send multiple different files to different individuals is no longer necessary.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Advanced SEO Tools and Plugins</span> : Content management systems offer a number of plugins and tools that can help your site rank better in major search engines. This doesn’t mean you should get rid of your online marketing team, but these tools can help implement a basic SEO strategy in an attempt to increase online traffic to your site.

                                    Other website options, like WYSIWYG editors, do not have tools and plugins available to specifically help optimize your web content for major search engines. WordPress plugins directly present options within the interface itself to include web page titles, meta descriptions, alt tags, and all the other elements needed to best optimize your website for Google and other major search engines. They will also alert you when these elements are not done correctly.
                                    
                                    What’s more, these plugins are regularly updated to adapt to any changes in major search engines that could affect your ranking. So, your website will remain optimized at all times, despite any updates or changes. Basically, CMSs, especially WordPress, are the only website options that allow you to easily optimize your website for search engines using user-friendly plugins and tools right within the editing interface itself.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Security</span> :In today’s world, the last thing anybody wants is for their website to be hacked, especially ecommerce website owners. Websites can be especially vulnerable, and are often targeted by hackers, to steal personal information.

                                    However, content management systems are consistently tested by an army of developers and computer scientists in an effort to protect users against any and all potential security threats. Additionally, there are countless plugins and tools available that are also individually designed to increase your website’s security.
                                
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Cost Effective and Affordable</span> :Website maintenance can be a major expense if you have a static website. Calling a web designer or developer to make frequent changes can add up. Not only is cost a factor, but you will most likely have to wait a few days to see the updates live on your site.

                                    Investing in a content management system can save you both time and money. With a content management system in place, you no longer have to rely on a web developer to make common site changes. You can instantly make these changes yourself exactly when you need them done.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Instant Site Maintenance</span> : Without a CMS, making changes to your site can be both time consuming and expensive. However, maintaining your site has never been easier nor quicker with CMS’.

                                    Content management systems allow you to upload or alter content with a few simple clicks of a button, rather than individually digging through pages of code to make an adjustment. Furthermore, general updates and other support requirements that maintain the well-being of your site can be conducted almost instantly, with another few clicks of a button.
                                    
                                    This ease of maintenance is no exception for the design elements of a website too. Content management systems allow for the visual components of a website to be altered with minimal to no coding. The best part is, all this can happen instantly from any device with any internet connection.

                            <h4>Advantages</h4>
                            <ul>

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">User-Friendly CMS</span> : Without any technical knowledge like website management and coding skills, the website owners or bloggers can edit & maintain their sites using easy-to-use features like drag and drop.
                               
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Open-Source Community</span> : One of the prime benefits is that WordPress is an open-source platform. It means the developer can use, change, and study the code without having to create it from scratch.

                                    Being open-source software, WordPress programmers can share the code online with other developers too. This helps in saving a lot of time and cost of writing & implementing a new codebase for minor or major changes.ou can easily modify and use the code without having to pay any license or subscription fees.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Customization</span> : Unlike other drag and drop web builder tools out there, WordPress is quite a flexible tool. However, if you’re not an expert of WordPress or if you don’t have a skilled WordPress developer for it, you might face some serious issues.

                                    Problems such as updating core WordPress can be troublesome as updating can break some of the functionality. Also, if you are not well-versed with the practices used for designing the site, it can become a problem too.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Vulnerability & Data Security</span> : One of the major disadvantages of this CMS is that it can be vulnerable in multiple cases. Since WordPress is an open-source platform, it opens the room to potential hackers.

                                    In order to mitigate this risk, choosing the right themes and plugins for your WordPress websites is crucial. Also, it is always good to assess the quality of a WordPress plugin before installing it.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold">Frequent Updates</span> : stalling WordPress is not enough. In order to make sure that it works properly, you have to install several plugins and themes. The more plugins you use, the more you’re going to encounter compatibility challenges.

                                    Besides, updating your site frequently might also hinder its functionality like plugins might stop working. Before updating your website, make sure you have a backup of your data.
