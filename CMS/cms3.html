                            <p>Here’s some benefits of using a CMS that aren’t available with other website options </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">No Programming Experience Required</span> : Content management systems, like WordPress, were built for users with little to no programming experience. Once your website is fully developed
                                    by a web design professional, managing the actual content on your website is simple and easy to learn.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Easy Collaboration and Access</span> : Content management systems allow multiple people to not only have access to your website, but also easily collaborate on different projects. Using
                                    individual accounts, multiple people can add, edit, or update content on the site right from their own computers or devices. CMS’ also store all of your online content for you in one place and is available to anyone
                                    with access to the website, meaning the need to send multiple different files to different individuals is no longer necessary.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Advanced site functionality</span> : Most systems allow the implementation of functionalities (forms, polls, quizzes, event calendars, etc.) that would otherwise be extremely hard to achieve;

                                <li>
                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Provide built-in Page Builder</span> : A main goal of using CMS is time saving. CMS provide built-in visual page creator to create, manage or modify the content of the site. User has no need to manage site content with in-line editing or also can create reusable dynamic blocks and the ability to save the block-section and page layout as template to reuse in multiple sites.
                                </li>

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Advanced SEO Tools and Plugins</span> : Content management systems offer a number of plugins and tools that can help your site rank better in major search engines. This doesn’t mean you
                                    should get rid of your online marketing team, but these tools can help implement a basic SEO strategy in an attempt to increase online traffic to your site. Other website options, like WYSIWYG editors, do not have tools
                                    and plugins available to specifically help optimize your web content for major search engines. WordPress plugins directly present options within the interface itself to include web page titles, meta descriptions, alt
                                    tags, and all the other elements needed to best optimize your website for Google and other major search engines. They will also alert you when these elements are not done correctly. What’s more, these plugins are regularly
                                    updated to adapt to any changes in major search engines that could affect your ranking. So, your website will remain optimized at all times, despite any updates or changes. Basically, CMSs, especially WordPress, are
                                    the only website options that allow you to easily optimize your website for search engines using user-friendly plugins and tools right within the editing interface itself.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Security</span> :In today’s world, the last thing anybody wants is for their website to be hacked, especially ecommerce website owners. Websites can be especially vulnerable, and are often
                                    targeted by hackers, to steal personal information. However, content management systems are consistently tested by an army of developers and computer scientists in an effort to protect users against any and all potential
                                    security threats. Additionally, there are countless plugins and tools available that are also individually designed to increase your website’s security.

                                    Not only is cost a factor, but you will most likely have to wait a few days to see the updates live on your site. Investing in a content management system can save you both time and money. With a content management
                                    system in place, you no longer have to rely on a web developer to make common site changes. You can instantly make these changes yourself exactly when you need them done.

                                    with CMS’. Content management systems allow you to upload or alter content with a few simple clicks of a button, rather than individually digging through pages of code to make an adjustment. Furthermore, general updates
                                    and other support requirements that maintain the well-being of your site can be conducted almost instantly, with another few clicks of a button. This ease of maintenance is no exception for the design elements of a
                                    website too. Content management systems allow for the visual components of a website to be altered with minimal to no coding. The best part is, all this can happen instantly from any device with any internet connection.

This can lead your development down the wrong path for the first prototype, wasting time, resources, and money.
                                    Removing the discovery phase may seem to put you on the fast track at first, but in the long run, can cause a chain reaction of setbacks, putting you further from your deployment goal.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Limited flexibility in Design</span> : CMS sites primarily use templates for design. They are easy to recognize because they have a standard format i.e. 2 or 3 column design with boxes
                                    placed in various positions to accommodate the content. The designer must stay within the confines of this type of template therefore he is limited in the flexibility and uniqueness of design that can reflect his business.

                                    numbers and/or symbols. Search engines have a difficult time spiderier these types of pages. Not all web designers will care to edit the code to make the CMS site search engine compatible.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">SEO Maintenance</span> : Since CMS sites often contain hundreds of pages it may be difficult to optimize them. For example it will take a long time to change the keywords in the copy and
                                    meta tags for that many pages. Keywords for web pages need to be refined and altered to keep pace with the changing demographics of peoples’ searches.

The prototypes may work for the current business need, but the future ones could be an entirely different ball game. 
                                    If you plan on upgrading the software application often and using it for a growing team and/or business, go  with a structured consulting process that includes business analysis and a heavier planning stage.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Slow Loading</span> : Because a CMS site is database driven you need to wait for the pages to be processed by the server. Since there are hundreds of pages they may be slow to load. This
                                    will cause you to lose visitors as most internet users have a short attention span. A site should only take a few seconds to load. A CMS site on a slow server or on a server that includes many other sites will make
                                    also take a long time to load.

                                    <span class="font-weight-bold ">Expensive Design</span> : CMS sites cost a lot more to design than static sites because a designer has to install and configure the database, design the template, then customize it to

Though most CMSs release updates/fixes/patches regularly widely used content management systems generally invite more hackers than websites that don’t use a content management system or hard coded websites.  Your hosting company may shut your website down if your website is not maintained as a security hole on your website can lead to other sites on the server being compromised.  This is now a standard practice for hosting companies.
